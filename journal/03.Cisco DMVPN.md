# 03.CCNP Security Series – DMVPN Site-to-Site VPN Lab

In this CCNP Security lab, we’re building a scalable, secure VPN using **Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)**. This approach simplifies large-scale VPNs by allowing spokes to dynamically form direct encrypted tunnels between each other — no need to manually define every peer relationship.

---

## What is DMVPN?

**Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)** is a Cisco VPN technology that allows sites (spokes) to securely connect through a central hub and, when needed, directly to other spokes — without predefining each connection.

DMVPN combines three core technologies:

- **Multipoint GRE (mGRE):** Allows multiple VPN peers to share a single tunnel interface.
- **NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol):** Works like a dynamic DNS for resolving tunnel-to-public IP mappings.
- **IPsec:** Encrypts GRE traffic for confidentiality and integrity.

This solution is ideal for growing topologies. It reduces administrative overhead and improves efficiency by offloading data from the hub once spokes discover each other.

## Tunnel Configuration – All Routers Use Tunnel3

### R1 – Hub

```bash
interface tunnel 3
 description DMVPN Hub
 ip address 172.16.123.1 255.255.255.0
 ip mtu 1400
 ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 tunnel key 6783
 ip nhrp authentication Cisco!23
 ip nhrp map multicast dynamic
 ip nhrp network-id 123
 ip nhrp redirect
 no ip split-horizon eigrp 1
 tunnel protection ipsec profile IP_PROFILE
````

### R2 – Spoke

```bash
interface tunnel 3
 description DMVPN Spoke site 2
 ip address 172.16.123.2 255.255.255.0
 ip mtu 1400
 ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 tunnel key 6783
 ip nhrp authentication Cisco!23
 ip nhrp map 172.16.123.1 15.1.1.1
 ip nhrp map multicast 15.1.1.1
 ip nhrp network-id 123
 ip nhrp nhs 172.16.123.1
 ip nhrp shortcut
 tunnel protection ipsec profile IP_PROFILE
```

### R3 – Spoke

```bash
interface tunnel 3
 description DMVPN Spoke site 3
 ip address 172.16.123.3 255.255.255.0
 ip mtu 1400
 ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 tunnel key 6783
 ip nhrp authentication Cisco!23
 ip nhrp map 172.16.123.1 15.1.1.1
 ip nhrp map multicast 15.1.1.1
 ip nhrp network-id 123
 ip nhrp nhs 172.16.123.1
 ip nhrp shortcut
 tunnel protection ipsec profile IP_PROFILE
```

---

## Routing – EIGRP Configuration

```bash
router eigrp 1
 network 10.0.0.0
 network 172.16.123.0 0.0.0.255
```

**Note:** On R1 (hub), include:

```bash
interface tunnel 3
 no ip split-horizon eigrp 1
```

**Why disable split-horizon?**
EIGRP by default does not advertise routes back out the same interface they were learned from. For DMVPN, this would prevent R2 from learning about R3's LAN and vice versa. Disabling this ensures spokes can learn each other's routes via the hub.

## IPsec and ISAKMP Configuration

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 10
 authentication pre-share
 hash sha256
 encryption aes 256
 group 15
 lifetime 3600

crypto isakmp key Cisco!23 address 0.0.0.0

crypto ipsec transform-set MY_SET esp-aes 128 esp-sha384-hmac
 mode transport

crypto ipsec profile IP_PROFILE
 set transform-set MY_SET
```

## Verification Commands 

### Tunnel and NHRP

```bash
show dmvpn
```

![show dmvpn](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/04.show_dmvpn.png)

* **What it shows:** Tunnel peer states, NHRP mappings, and DMVPN mode.
* **Why use it:** Confirm whether dynamic tunnels are forming correctly between spokes. Check if peer tunnels are `UP`.

```bash
show ip nhrp
```

![show ip nhrp](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/05.show_ip_nhrp.png)

* **What it shows:** Tunnel IPs mapped to public IPs, NHRP cache entries.
* **Why use it:** Validate whether spokes are correctly registered with the hub and can resolve each other.

### Routing

```bash
show ip route
```

![show ip route](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/06.show_ip_route.png)

* **What it shows:** Full routing table.
* **Why use it:** Confirm that remote LANs are reachable over the tunnel and EIGRP is properly advertising routes.

```bash
show ip cef 10.3.0.0
```

![show ip cef](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/07.show_ip_cef.png)

* **What it shows:** CEF forwarding path for the 10.3.0.0/24 network.
* **Why use it:** Useful to troubleshoot path selection and verify correct next-hop resolution for remote destinations.

```bash
show ip eigrp neighbors
```

![show ip eigrp neigbors](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/08.show_ip_eigrp_neigbors.png)

* **What it shows:** EIGRP adjacency with peers.
* **Why use it:** Confirm that EIGRP is forming neighbors across the DMVPN tunnel interface.

```bash
show ip route eigrp
```

![show ip route eigrp](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/09.show_ip_route_eigrp.png)

* **What it shows:** Routes learned specifically through EIGRP.
* **Why use it:** Filter out EIGRP-learned routes to validate dynamic routing is functioning.

### IPsec and Encryption

```bash
show crypto isakmp sa
```

![show crypto isakmp sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/11.show_crypto_isakmp_sa.png)

* **Why use it:** Useful to identify session status — `UP-ACTIVE` means tunnel is functional.

```bash
show crypto engine connections active
```

![show crypto engine](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/13.show_crypto_engine_connections_active.png)

```

![ping test](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Cisco_DMVPN/14.ping_test.png)

* **What it shows:** End-to-end reachability from one spoke to another.
* **Why use it:** Validates that NHRP and IPsec are working, and that routing is correct.

## Summary

In this lab, we built a secure, scalable DMVPN topology using:

* **Tunnel3** for all routers
* **GRE multipoint tunnels** with `tunnel key` and `ip mtu` optimizations
* **NHRP** for spoke discovery and mapping
* **EIGRP** for dynamic route exchange
* **IPsec** in transport mode for encrypted GRE tunnels
* **Verification commands** that reveal tunnel, routing, and crypto health

## Next Steps

In the next lab, we’ll explore **GET VPN**, a tunnel-less encryption method that’s ideal for secure, scalable multicast and full-mesh communication in enterprise WANs.

Never stop learning.
