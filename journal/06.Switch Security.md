# 06.CCNP Switch Security Lab â€“ Switch Hardening with DHCP Snooping, DAI, IP Source Guard, Port Security

This lab demonstrates a Layer 2 security configuration between two multilayer switches (MSW1 and MSW2) with a focus on switch hardening best practices. Features implemented include:

- VLAN interface (SVI) configuration and DHCP relay on MSW1  
- Port security with sticky MAC, shutdown and protect modes  
- DHCP snooping and DAI with validation  
- IP source guard  
- Portfast for end devices  
- Isolation of unused ports in a blackhole VLAN  
- Verification steps for each feature

## VLAN Creation and SVI Configuration (MSW1)

```bash
vlan 10
 name VLAN10
vlan 20
 name VLAN20
vlan 30
 name VLAN30
vlan 999
 name BLACKHOLE
````

Creates required VLANs. VLAN 999 is used to isolate unused ports.

```bash
interface vlan 1
 ip address 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

interface vlan 10
 ip address 10.0.10.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.12.5
 no shutdown

interface vlan 20
 ip address 10.0.20.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.12.5
 no shutdown

interface vlan 30
 ip address 10.0.30.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.12.5
 no shutdown
```

These SVIs assign MSW1 as the default gateway for each VLAN.
The `ip helper-address` command forwards DHCP requests to the server at 192.168.12.5, which is located in VLAN 1.

---

## DHCP Snooping (MSW1 and MSW2)

```bash
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 1,10,20,30
no ip dhcp snooping information option
```

* Enables DHCP snooping globally.
* Activates snooping for VLANs 1, 10, 20, and 30.
* Disables Option 82 insertion to avoid DHCP server rejection if not supported.

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 description Uplink to peer switch
 ip dhcp snooping trust

interface GigabitEthernet1/0/24
 description Connected to DHCP server
 ip dhcp snooping trust
```

These ports are marked as **trusted** since they either lead to the DHCP server or to another switch relaying valid DHCP offers. All other ports remain untrusted by default, dropping DHCP offers not from these interfaces.

---

## Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)

```bash
ip arp inspection vlan 1,10,20,30
ip arp inspection validate src-mac dst-mac ip
ip arp inspection limit rate 100
```

* Enables DAI on the same VLANs as DHCP snooping.
* The `validate` command checks that ARP packets have consistent source MAC, destination MAC, and IP information.
* Rate limiting prevents ARP flooding attacks by capping ARP packets per second.

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 ip arp inspection trust
```

DAI only trusts ARP replies from this trunk port (uplink). All other interfaces must have a matching DHCP binding for ARP replies to be accepted.

---

## IP Source Guard

```bash
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/2 , GigabitEthernet1/0/10 , GigabitEthernet1/0/24
 ip verify source
```

This feature filters packets based on the DHCP snooping binding table. Only valid IP-MAC-port combinations can send traffic. Spoofed packets are dropped.

---

## Port Security

### On User Access Ports

```bash
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/2 , GigabitEthernet1/0/10 , GigabitEthernet1/0/24
 switchport mode access
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security violation shutdown
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
 spanning-tree portfast
```

* Restricts each access port to **2 MAC addresses**.
* Uses **sticky MAC** to dynamically learn and store addresses in the running config.
* If a violation occurs (e.g., a third device is plugged in), the port is **shut down**.
* `portfast` enables fast convergence for end devices.

### On Uplink Port (Trunk)

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,20,30
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 200
 switchport port-security violation protect
```

* Allows only VLANs 1, 10, 20, and 30 on the trunk.
* Limits the number of learned MACs to 200.
* On violation, unknown traffic is silently dropped (`protect`), but the interface remains up.

---

## Blackhole VLAN for Unused Ports

```bash
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/3 - 9 , GigabitEthernet1/0/11 - 15 , GigabitEthernet1/0/16 - 23,
GigabitEthernet1/1/1 - 4
 switchport access vlan 999
 shutdown
```

All unused ports are moved to VLAN 999 and administratively shut down. This prevents unauthorized access or rogue devices from connecting.

---

## Errdisable Recovery

```bash
errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation
errdisable recovery interval 30
```

If a port is shut down due to port security violation, this automatically recovers it after 30 seconds. Useful for reducing manual intervention in case of accidental violations.

---

## Verification Commands

### DHCP Snooping

```bash
show ip dhcp snooping
```

Displays trusted interfaces, VLANs with snooping enabled, and global settings.

```bash
show ip dhcp snooping binding
```

Lists the MAC-to-IP bindings created by DHCP snooping.

---

### ARP Inspection

```bash
show ip arp inspection
```

Displays status of DAI, including trusted interfaces.

```bash
show ip arp inspection statistics
```

Shows ARP packet drops, validation errors, and rate limit hits.

---

### IP Source Guard

```bash
show ip verify source
```

Verifies which interfaces have source guard enabled and how many entries are installed.

---

### Port Security

```bash
show port-security
```

Shows global port security status and counts.

```bash
show port-security interface G1/0/2
```

Detailed view of port configuration, learned MACs, and violation state.

---

### Errdisable Recovery

```bash
show errdisable recovery
```

Verifies recovery interval and causes being monitored.

---

### VLANs and Trunking

```bash
show interfaces trunk
```

Verifies allowed VLANs on trunk links.

```bash
show vlan brief
```

Lists VLAN assignments and port membership.

---

### Disabled or Isolated Ports

```bash
show interfaces status err-disabled
```

Confirms which ports are administratively disabled due to violation.

```bash
show interfaces status
```

Checks that unused ports are correctly assigned to VLAN 999.

---

## Summary

In this switch security lab:

* DHCP snooping restricts rogue DHCP offers and builds the binding table
* Dynamic ARP Inspection prevents spoofed ARP replies using DHCP data
* Port security enforces MAC limits with sticky learning
* IP source guard blocks invalid IP/MAC traffic at the edge
* Portfast accelerates convergence on access ports
* Unused ports are shut down and isolated in VLAN 999
* Only required VLANs are allowed on trunk links to reduce exposure
* All features are verified with clear CLI outputs

This setup strengthens Layer 2 security at the access layer, aligning with best practices for enterprise-grade switching environments.
