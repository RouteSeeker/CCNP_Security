# 04.CCNP Security Series – Cisco GET VPN Lab

Continuing the CCNP VPN series, this lab focuses on implementing **Cisco GET VPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN)** using one Key Server (KS) and three Group Members (GMs). GET VPN encrypts traffic using IPsec in **transport mode**, preserving the original IP header. This enables efficient routing and QoS, making it ideal for full-mesh private WAN environments.

## Lab Topology

| Router | Role         | Transport IP     | Loopback IP | LAN IP         |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| R1     | Group Member | 15.1.1.1         | 1.1.1.1     | 10.1.0.1       |
| R2     | Group Member | 25.1.1.1         | 2.2.2.2     | 10.2.0.1       |
| R3     | Group Member | 35.1.1.1         | 3.3.3.3     | 10.3.0.1       |
| R4     | Key Server   | 45.1.1.1         | 4.4.4.4     |                |

All loopback addresses are advertised through a dynamic routing protocol to ensure reachability.

## Key Server Configuration (R4)

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 10
 encryption aes 128
 hash sha256
 group 15
 authentication pre-share
 lifetime 3600
exit
````

**Defines the IKE Phase 1 policy** used to establish a secure ISAKMP tunnel with GMs. Uses AES 128-bit encryption, SHA-256 for integrity, and DH Group 15.

```bash
crypto isakmp key Cisco!23 address 0.0.0.0
```

**Sets a pre-shared key** to authenticate all GMs.

```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set MY_TS esp-aes esp-sha384-hmac
```

**Defines the transform set** to be used during Phase 2 for encryption and authentication using AES and SHA-384.

```bash
crypto ipsec profile MY_IP_Profile
 set transform-set MY_TS
 set security-association lifetime seconds 3600
exit
```

**Creates the IPsec profile** used by GET VPN group members. It ties the transform set and defines the SA lifetime.

```bash
crypto key generate rsa general-keys label KS-Key modulus 2048 exportable
```

**Generates an RSA key pair** for use in GDOI rekey authentication.

```bash
ip access-list extended My-list
 permit ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
 deny ip any any
exit
```

**Defines the traffic to be encrypted**. Only inter-site traffic within the 10.0.0.0/8 range will be protected.

```bash
crypto gdoi group My_GETVPN_Group
 identity number 3685

 server local
  address ipv4 4.4.4.4
  rekey lifetime seconds 1800
  rekey retransmit 40 number 2
  rekey authentication mypubkey rsa KS-KS-Key
  rekey transport unicast
  sa ipsec 54
   profile MY_IP_Profile
   match address ipv4 My-list
   replay time window-size 5
exit
```

**Configures the GDOI group and policy distribution**:

* `identity number`: Uniquely identifies the group.
* `server local`: Declares R4 as the KS.
* `rekey authentication`: Uses RSA key to sign rekey messages.
* `rekey transport`: Sends unicast rekey messages.
* `match address`: Defines traffic to protect using the ACL.
* `profile`: Ties the policy to the IPsec profile.

## Group Member Configuration (R1, R2, R3)

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 10
 encryption aes 128
 hash sha256
 group 15
 authentication pre-share
 lifetime 3600
exit
```

**Matches the ISAKMP policy** used by the Key Server.

```bash
crypto isakmp key Cisco!23 address 0.0.0.0
```

**Uses the same pre-shared key** to authenticate with the KS.

```bash
crypto gdoi group My_GETVPN_Group
 identity number 3685
 server address ipv4 4.4.4.4
exit
```

**Defines the GET VPN group** and registers with the KS at `4.4.4.4`.

```bash
crypto map GM-Map 10 gdoi
 set group My_GETVPN_Group
```

**Configures a crypto map** for GDOI, pointing to the defined group.

```bash
interface E0/0
 crypto map GM-Map
exit
```

**Applies the crypto map** to the WAN-facing interface to enable GET VPN functionality.

## Verification Commands

### On the Key Server (R4)

```bash
show crypto gdoi ks
```

![show crpto gdoi](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/04.Cisco%20GET%20VPN/02.crypto_gdoi.png)

**Shows the status of the Key Server**, including groups and member count.

```bash
show crypto gdoi ks policy
```

![show crypto gdoi ks policy](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/04.Cisco%20GET%20VPN/06.crypto_gdoi_policy.png)

**Verifies crypto policies assigned to the group**, including ACL matching rules and IPsec profile bindings.

---

### On the Group Members (R1–R3)

```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```

![show crypto ipsec sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/04.Cisco%20GET%20VPN/03.crypto_ipsec_before.png)

**Displays the current IPsec SAs** and shows packet counters for encrypted traffic.

```bash
ping 10.2.0.1 source 10.1.0.1 repeat 500
```

![ping source](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/04.Cisco%20GET%20VPN/04.ping_test.png)

**Sends traffic between sites** to generate encrypted flows.

```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```

![show crypto ipsec sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/04.Cisco%20GET%20VPN/05.crytpo_after.png)

**Run again to confirm** that encrypted packet counters increment.

## Summary

In this lab, we implemented **GET VPN** using the following components:

* One Key Server using pre-shared IKEv1 authentication and RSA key for rekeying
* Three Group Members registered using GDOI
* IPsec transport-mode encryption using AES and SHA-384
* An ACL to protect inter-site traffic within 10.0.0.0/8
* A fully dynamic routing core for loopback and KS reachability

GET VPN is efficient for private WAN environments where original IP headers must be preserved for routing and QoS.

## Next Lab

The next lab in this CCNP VPN series will focus on **Flex VPN**, Cisco’s modern IKEv2-based framework that supports remote access, hub-and-spoke, and dynamic VPN architectures.

Never stop learning.
