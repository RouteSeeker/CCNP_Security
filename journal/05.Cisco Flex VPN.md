# 05.Cisco Flex VPN (IKEv2) Site-to-Site Lab

This lab wraps up the VPN segment of the CCNP series with **Cisco Flex VPN**, a modern, modular VPN solution built around **IKEv2**. Flex VPN simplifies the configuration of site-to-site, hub-and-spoke, and remote access VPNs using a consistent policy-based approach.

In this scenario, we’ll establish a **site-to-site Flex VPN** between two routers using **pre-shared key authentication**, **IPsec in tunnel mode**, and **IKEv2**. EIGRP is used for routing between the loopback and LAN networks over the tunnel. The tunnel interface on both ends is `Tunnel3`.

## Lab Topology

| Router | WAN IP       | Tunnel IP     | Loopback  | LAN         |
|--------|--------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| R1     | 15.1.1.1     | 10.12.12.1    | 1.1.1.1   | 10.1.0.0/24 |
| R2     | 25.2.2.1     | 10.12.12.2    | 2.2.2.2   | 10.2.0.0/24 |

## Step 1: IKEv2 Proposal

```bash
crypto ikev2 proposal default
 group 16
exit
````

**What it does:**
This proposal defines the **Diffie-Hellman group** used for IKE SA key exchange. In this case, Group 16 offers high security using a 4096-bit modulus.

**Important Note:**
This configuration does not explicitly define the **encryption** or **integrity** algorithms. IOS may apply system defaults (commonly AES and SHA1), but this behavior can vary by platform and version. It is generally recommended to **explicitly define encryption and integrity** settings to ensure consistent security posture and avoid negotiation failures with other devices.

---

## Step 2: IKEv2 Keyring

### R1:

```bash
crypto ikev2 keyring IOS-Keys
 peer R2
  address 25.2.2.1
  pre-shared-key Cisco!23
exit
```

### R2:

```bash
crypto ikev2 keyring IOS-Keys
 peer R1
  address 15.1.1.1
  pre-shared-key Cisco!23
exit
```

**What it does:**
Maps each peer’s public IP address to a **pre-shared key**, which is used for mutual authentication during IKEv2 negotiation.

---

## Step 3: IKEv2 Profile

### R1:

```bash
crypto ikev2 profile flex-profile
 match identity remote address 25.2.2.1 255.255.255.255
 authentication remote pre-share
 authentication local pre-share
 keyring local IOS-Keys
exit
```

### R2:

```bash
crypto ikev2 profile flex-profile
 match identity remote address 15.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
 authentication remote pre-share
 authentication local pre-share
 keyring local IOS-Keys
exit
```

**What it does:**
This profile governs how the router handles IKEv2 connections.

* `match identity remote address`: Accepts connections only from the specified peer IP
* `authentication`: Specifies the use of pre-shared keys
* `keyring local`: Binds this profile to the keyring created earlier

---

## Step 4: IPsec Transform Set and Profile

```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set flex-set esp-aes 256 esp-sha384-hmac
 mode tunnel
exit

crypto ipsec profile flex-ipsec-profile
 set transform-set flex-set
 set ikev2-profile flex-profile
exit
```

**What it does:**
Defines the IPsec security parameters and binds them to the IKEv2 profile:

* AES-256 for encryption
* SHA384 for integrity
* Tunnel mode for site-to-site communication

---

## Step 5: Tunnel Interface Configuration

### R1:

```bash
interface tunnel 3
 ip address 10.12.12.1 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel destination 25.2.2.1
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
 tunnel protection ipsec profile flex-ipsec-profile
exit
```

### R2:

```bash
interface tunnel 3
 ip address 10.12.12.2 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel destination 15.1.1.1
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
 tunnel protection ipsec profile flex-ipsec-profile
exit
```

**What it does:**

* Creates a **Tunnel3** interface for encrypted traffic
* Secures traffic using the IPsec profile configured earlier
* Establishes the GRE/IPsec-like behavior without encapsulation overhead

---

## Step 6: EIGRP Routing

```bash
router eigrp 10
 network 10.1.0.0 0.0.0.255
 network 10.12.12.0 0.0.0.255
 network 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0
```

```bash
router eigrp 10
 network 10.2.0.0 0.0.0.255
 network 10.12.12.0 0.0.0.255
 network 2.2.2.2 0.0.0.0
```

**What it does:**
Enables dynamic routing over the IPsec tunnel. This allows full communication between LAN and loopback networks behind each router.

## Verification Commands

```bash
show crypto ikev2 proposal
```

![ikev2 proposal](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/05.CiscoFlexVPN/02.ikev2_proposal.png)

Checks the configured IKEv2 proposal. Verify if defaults were used.

```bash
show crypto ikev2 sa
```

![ikev2 sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/05.CiscoFlexVPN/03.ikev2_sa.png)

Verifies IKEv2 SA formation between peers.

```bash
show crypto ipsec transform-set
```

![transform set](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/05.CiscoFlexVPN/04.ipsec_transform_set.png)

Confirms the configured transform-set parameters.

```bash
show crypto ipsec profile
```

![ipsec profile](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/05.CiscoFlexVPN/05.ipsec%20profile.png)

Validates which transform set and IKEv2 profile are attached.

```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```

![ipsec sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/05.CiscoFlexVPN/06.ipsec_sa.png)

Displays IPsec tunnel state and packet encryption/decryption counts.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **IKEv2 SA does not form**

  * Confirm both peers use matching PSKs and identity settings
  * Ensure `match identity remote address` is correct
  * Check for firewall rules or NAT affecting UDP 500 or 4500

* **IPsec SA counters do not increment**

  * Ensure traffic is actually flowing (e.g., ping from LAN to LAN)
  * Use `debug crypto ikev2` to trace negotiation issues

* **Tunnel interface remains down**

  * Confirm correct IP addresses and interface bindings
  * Ensure both routers’ WAN interfaces are reachable

---

## Summary

This Flex VPN lab used:

* Pre-shared keys for authentication
* IKEv2 with DH group 16
* Explicit IPsec policy with AES256 and SHA384
* IPsec-secured Tunnel3 interface
* EIGRP to advertise both LAN and loopback networks

This is a clean, modular approach to secure site-to-site VPNs using Cisco's latest VPN framework.
