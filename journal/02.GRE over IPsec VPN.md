# CCNP Security Series – GRE over IPsec VPN Configuration

This week's lab continues the VPN series by focusing on **GRE over IPsec**. This setup allows us to run dynamic routing protocols over an encrypted VPN tunnel. GRE provides the routing flexibility, and IPsec adds the encryption layer.

---

## Lab Topology

This lab uses two PCs and three routers:

- **Internet Router**
  - Connected to R1 on `15.1.1.2/24`
  - Connected to R2 on `25.2.2.2/24`

- **R1**
  - Connected to Internet router via `15.1.1.1/24`
  - Connected to PC1 via `10.1.0.1/24`

- **R2**
  - Connected to Internet router via `25.2.2.1/24`
  - Connected to PC2 via `10.2.0.1/24`

The GRE tunnel (Tunnel 21) runs between R1 and R2 on the `10.12.12.0/24` network.

## GRE Tunnel Configuration

### R1:
```bash
interface tunnel 21
 ip address 10.12.12.1 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel destination 25.2.2.1
exit
````

### R2:

```bash
interface tunnel 21
 ip address 10.12.12.2 255.255.255.0
 tunnel source e0/0
 tunnel destination 15.1.1.1
exit
```

**Explanation:**

* `interface tunnel 21`: Creates a GRE tunnel with logical ID 21.
* `ip address`: Assigns a /24 subnet for communication over the tunnel.
* `tunnel source`: Uses the external interface to source the GRE tunnel.
* `tunnel destination`: Specifies the peer’s external IP to build the tunnel.

---

## EIGRP Configuration

We use EIGRP to route between internal networks over the GRE tunnel.

### R1:

```bash
router eigrp 1
 no auto-summary
 network 10.0.0.0
end
```

### R2:

```bash
router eigrp 1
 no auto-summary
 network 10.0.0.0
end
```

**Explanation:**

* `no auto-summary`: Disables automatic summarization to allow for classless routing.
* `network 10.0.0.0`: Advertises all interfaces in the 10.0.0.0/8 range, which includes the LANs and tunnel interface.

---

## IPsec Configuration

We now secure the GRE tunnel using IPsec.

### IKE Phase 1 – ISAKMP Policy

**R1 and R2:**

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 5
 authentication pre-share
 hash sha256
 encryption aes 256
 group 15
 lifetime 3600
exit

crypto isakmp key Cisco!23 address 0.0.0.0
```

**Explanation:**

* Defines the IKE Phase 1 policy with AES-256 encryption and SHA-256 hashing.
* `group 15`: Diffie-Hellman group for key exchange.
* Shared key `Cisco!23` used for peer authentication.

---

### IKE Phase 2 – IPsec Configuration

**R1 and R2:**

```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set IP_SET esp-aes 128 esp-sha384-hmac
 mode tunnel
exit

crypto ipsec profile IP_PROFILE
 set transform-set IP_SET
exit
```

**Explanation:**

* `transform-set IP_SET`: Defines ESP encryption (AES-128) and integrity (SHA-384).
* `crypto ipsec profile`: Ties the transform-set to a named profile.

---

### Applying IPsec to the Tunnel

**R1 and R2:**

```bash
interface tunnel 21
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
 tunnel protection ipsec profile IP_PROFILE
exit
```

**Explanation:**

* `tunnel mode ipsec ipv4`: Converts the GRE tunnel to run in IPsec-protected mode.
* `tunnel protection`: Applies the IPsec profile to encrypt traffic.

---

## Verification Commands

Use the following to verify the IPsec tunnel is established:

```bash
show crypto isakmp policy
```
![show crypto isakmp policy](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.GRE_Over_VPN/03.crypto-policy.png)

Displays the IKE Phase 1 policies.


```bash
show crypto map
```
![show crypto map](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.GRE_Over_VPN/04.crypto-map.png)

```bash
show crypto isakmp sa
```
![show crypto isakmp sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.GRE_Over_VPN/05.isakmp-sa.png)

Shows IKE SA status. Look for `QM_IDLE` to confirm Phase 1 is complete.

```bash
show crypto isakmp sa detail
```

![isakmp sa detail](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.GRE_Over_VPN/06.isakmp-sa-detail.png)

Provides detailed information on SA state and parameters.

```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```
![ipsec sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.GRE_Over_VPN/07.isakmp-ipsec-sa.png)

Displays Phase 2 status. Check encrypted/decrypted packet counts.

```bash
show crypto engine connections active
```
![engine connections active](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/02.GRE_Over_VPN/08.connections-active.png)

Lists active encryption sessions currently being processed.

## Summary

In this lab, we:

* Built a GRE tunnel between R1 and R2
* Used EIGRP to advertise internal networks
* Secured GRE traffic using IPsec profiles
* Verified tunnel encryption using relevant `show crypto` commands

## What's Next

In the next lab, I’ll be building on this foundation with **DMVPN**, which introduces multipoint tunneling, spoke-hub-spoke architectures, and dynamic IPsec peer discovery — ideal for scalable environments.

Never stop learning!
