# CCNP Security Series – Site-to-Site VPN with Crypto Map and IKEv1

Welcome to the first lab in my CCNP Security series. This series is designed both as a preparation tool for the CCNP Security exam and as a personal reference guide.

In this lab, I configured a Site-to-Site IPsec VPN using crypto maps and IKEv1. The setup involves two routers that connect internal LANs across an untrusted network (the internet). This configuration encrypts traffic between the two LANs using IKE Phase 1 and Phase 2 security associations.

## Lab Topology

- **Internet Router**
  - Connected to R1 via 15.1.1.2/24
  - Connected to R2 via 25.2.2.2/24

- **R1**
  - WAN: 15.1.1.1/24
  - LAN: 10.1.0.1 (PC1 subnet)

- **R2**
  - WAN: 25.2.2.1/24
  - LAN: 10.2.0.1 (PC2 subnet)

## IKE Phase 1 Configuration

R1:

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 5
 authentication pre-share
 hash sha256
 encryption aes 256
 group 15
 lifetime 3600
exit

crypto isakmp key Cisco!23 address 25.2.2.1
````

R2:

```bash
crypto isakmp policy 5
 authentication pre-share
 hash sha256
 encryption aes 256
 group 15
 lifetime 3600
exit

crypto isakmp key Cisco!23 address 15.1.1.1
```

**Explanation:**

* `crypto isakmp policy 5`: Defines IKE Phase 1 negotiation parameters using priority 5.
* `authentication pre-share`: Uses a pre-shared key (PSK) for peer authentication.
* `hash sha256`: Hashing algorithm used for integrity checks.
* `encryption aes 256`: AES-256 used for encrypting the IKE Phase 1 session.
* `group 15`: Diffie-Hellman group used to generate shared key material.
* `lifetime 3600`: SA lifetime in seconds.
* `crypto isakmp key`: Defines the PSK used with a specific peer IP address.

---

## IKE Phase 2 Configuration

R1 and R2:

```bash
crypto ipsec transform-set TS_SET esp-aes 128 esp-sha384-hmac
 mode tunnel
exit
```

**Explanation:**

* `transform-set`: Defines the security protocols for IPsec — AES-128 encryption and SHA-384 for authentication.
* `mode tunnel`: Required for site-to-site VPNs to encapsulate IP packets.

## Defining Interesting Traffic (Crypto ACL)

R1:

```bash
ip access-list extended Crypto-ACL
 permit ip 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 10.2.0.0 0.0.255.255
exit
```

R2:

```bash
ip access-list extended Crypto-ACL
 permit ip 10.2.0.0 0.0.255.255 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255
exit
```

**Explanation:** This ACL defines which traffic should be encrypted. In this case, traffic between the 10.1.0.0/16 and 10.2.0.0/16 subnets.

---

## Crypto Map Configuration

R1:

```bash
crypto map My_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 match address Crypto-ACL
 set peer 25.2.2.1
 set transform-set TS_SET
 set pfs group15
exit

interface Ethernet0/1
 crypto map My_MAP
```

R2:

```bash
crypto map My_MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp
 match address Crypto-ACL
 set peer 15.1.1.1
 set transform-set TS_SET
 set pfs group15
exit

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 crypto map My_MAP
```

**Explanation:**

* `match address`: Matches traffic specified in the ACL.
* `set peer`: IP address of the VPN peer.
* `set transform-set`: Defines which transform set to use.
* `set pfs group15`: Enables Perfect Forward Secrecy using group 15.
* `crypto map My_MAP`: Associates this configuration to an interface, enabling VPN functionality.

## Verification Commands and What They Do

```bash
show crypto isakmp policy
```

Displays configured ISAKMP policies and their priorities, encryption, hash, and DH groups.

![show isakmp policy](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Site-to-Site%20VPN%20with%20Crypto%20Map%20and%20IKEv1/02.isakmp-sa.png)

```bash
show crypto map
```

Shows the crypto map applied to interfaces and details like peers, transform sets, and ACLs.

![show crypto map](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Site-to-Site%20VPN%20with%20Crypto%20Map%20and%20IKEv1/03.crypto-map.png)

```bash
show crypto isakmp sa
```

Displays the status of current IKE Phase 1 Security Associations. If successful, you should see "QM\_IDLE."

![show isakmp sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Site-to-Site%20VPN%20with%20Crypto%20Map%20and%20IKEv1/09.isakmp-sa.png)

```bash
show crypto isakmp sa detail
```

Provides a deeper look into IKE SA parameters such as local/remote IPs, lifetimes, and state transitions.

![show isakmp sa detail](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Site-to-Site%20VPN%20with%20Crypto%20Map%20and%20IKEv1/04.isakmp-detail.png)

```bash
show crypto ipsec sa
```

Displays IPsec Phase 2 information. It shows the number of encrypted and decrypted packets, tunnel mode, and current status.

![ipsec sa]
(https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Site-to-Site%20VPN%20with%20Crypto%20Map%20and%20IKEv1/08.ipsec-sa-after.png)

```bash
show crypto engine connections active
```

Displays active encryption engine sessions and how many packets are being processed.

![engine connection](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNP_Security/blob/main/assets/screenshots/01.Site-to-Site%20VPN%20with%20Crypto%20Map%20and%20IKEv1/05.engine-connection.png)

## Troubleshooting Tips

* Ensure IP reachability between peers on their public-facing interfaces.
* Double-check that both routers are using matching IKE policies and transform sets.
* The crypto ACLs must be exact mirror images of each other.
* If there is NAT involved, ensure NAT-T (NAT Traversal) is enabled.
* Use `debug crypto isakmp` and `debug crypto ipsec` for real-time logs.

## Comparing Crypto Map with Modern VPN Approaches

* **Crypto Map:** Static, legacy method. Great for learning and foundational understanding.
* **VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface):** More scalable and flexible. Allows routing protocols to run across tunnels.
* **IKEv2:** More robust and modern than IKEv1, with support for MOBIKE and faster rekeying.

For exam preparation and real-world environments with older hardware, crypto maps remain relevant and important to understand.

## Conclusion

This lab provided a complete walkthrough of how to build a secure Site-to-Site IPsec VPN using crypto maps and IKEv1. We covered every component from scratch, explained each configuration step, and provided commands for validation.

Stay tuned for more CCNP Security labs where I’ll build on this foundation and explore additional technologies.
