# CCNP_Security

This repository is a structured resource for studying and preparing for the Cisco CCNP Security certification. It includes organized study notes, configuration examples, and concise command-line cheat sheets aimed at reinforcing practical knowledge and simplifying revision.

## What This Repository Contains

- Study Notes: Summarized explanations of each core topic from SCOR, SVPN, SISE, and SFW exams.
- Configuration References: Command-line configurations for VPNs, Firewalls, ISE integration, AAA, and security policies.
- CLI Cheat Sheets: Compact command summaries and usage patterns for efficient recall during lab sessions.
- Lab Topologies (in progress): Sample topologies built on platforms such as CML and GNS3 to support hands-on testing.

## Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as my personal knowledge base while working through the CCNP Security curriculum. By documenting key concepts and configurations, the goal is to:

- Build long-term retention through repetition and lab work
- Consolidate scattered notes into a single, searchable location
- Provide a streamlined reference for others preparing for the same exams

## Topics Covered

- SCOR: Core Security Technologies
- SVPN: Secure Site-to-Site and Remote Access VPNs
- SFW: Secure Firewalls (ASA and FTD)
- SISE: Cisco Identity Services Engine and AAA and more


This repository is continuously updated. Contributions, corrections, or suggestions are welcome.
